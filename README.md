# Drowsiness-Detection
This project showcases a smart Driver Drowsiness Detection System built with Python, 
OpenCV, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe. It combines computer vision and deep learning 
to monitor eye closure, yawning, and lip movements in real-time, helping prevent 
accidents caused by fatigue. Using a CNN model based on InceptionV3 and 
MediaPipeâ€™s Face Mesh, the system accurately classifies eye states and analyzes facial 
behavior. With real-time webcam monitoring, visual alerts, and audio warnings, it 
offers a practical, scalable solution to improve road safety and driver awareness.
